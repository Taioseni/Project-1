# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
1. To answer the questions by running syntaxes and querying the database
2. To analyse the entire data base of e-commerce using pgadmin4
4. The cleaned data will help make informed decisions on the customers database 

## Process
1. Loading the civ files into the pgAdmin database
2. Understanding the data to be cleaned
3. Answering the questions provided.
4. Generate 3-5 questions and answer them based on the data
5. Showing the queries used in cleaning the data.


## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)
1. The dataset was extensive and comprised numerous tables, presenting a challenge given the time constraints. Merging these tables proved to be complex, as the data lacked a clear, intuitive structure. Despite this, as I delved deeper into the analysis, my understanding of the dataset improved, although this process was quite time-intensive.

2. Transforming the sizable dataset within a tight timeframe posed a significant challenge, especially due to the presence of numerous irrelevant columns. Additionally, the dataset contained many columns with null values, and there was a mix-up between country and city data, which added to the complexity of the task.

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?) 
1. It would help me in documentation and knowledge share with others
2. If I had more time I would have used the data to build a dash board and cleaned the data more as it was really messy.
3. I would have made more tables thereby reducing the data from all_sessions and also merged all the data into a new table to have a better visualization and understanding through one table
